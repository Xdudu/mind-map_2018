## 沉溺于猫图无法集中注意力写README了
---

第二次写思维导图，React已经写得比较自如了，webpack也可以不那么痛苦地配好，Redux上手还算顺利。还是熟悉的味道，配方变了一些些，不变的是心中始终想呈现出一个小而美应用的想法。也仍然在往这个方向努力着~

这次不写应用功能简介了，Github Pages在线玩耍地址在此，请君食用~[戳我传送](https://xdudu.github.io/mind-map_2018/)。


Added readme :)

## Overview
In 2018, I rewrote [this project](https://github.com/Xdudu/mind-map), as a way to learn redux. From product design, to UI design, then coding, I enjoyed doing all the things myself as I always did in personal projects. Looking back from now(01.2020), I could still taste the immaturity, in both design and coding. Many features are not implemented, some code could be written in a better way, there is so much to do! I think some day I'll pick it up again and inject more inspiration :)

## Feature
* unlimited level of nodes
* no isolated area of settings or so, the whole space is for you to focus and create the map.
* hover on a node to create parent/sibling/child nodes
* click and select a node to:
  * numbering child nodes
  * copy tree from node
  * paste copied tree
  * cut tree from node
  * delete node or the whole tree from node
  
## Todo
* insert image
* export as pdf/image
